Jquery Intro
============

## 2nd Semester Multimedia Design and Communication

A Jquery boiler plate.


## Jquery and WordPress

1. Copy `header.php` from the Twenty Seventeen folder to your child theme folder. If you've got the file, just edit the lines in 2.

2. Add [support for Jquery](https://github.com/asathoor/jquery-introduction/blob/master/header.php#L25-L26). 

3. In the Dashboard create a page or post. Save the page. Note the slug, and create a file named: `page-SLUG.php` (where SLUG is the page slug).

4. Copy the code in `jq-and-wordpress.php` to your file and save it.

5. View your page on WordPress.

Since there's no loop, there will be no content apart from what you do with the Jquery. If you want content, add a [loop](https://codex.wordpress.org/The_Loop).
